## üì± Usage Guide

### Step 1: Base License
The base MSSP license ($15,000/year) is automatically included and shows all included features.

### Step 2: Add Customer Tenants
- Browse the 5 available tenant tiers
- Click "Add Tenant" for any tier to include it in your calculation
- Remove tenants using the X button in the selected tenants list

### Step 3: Configure Add-ons
- Use quantity selectors (0-10) for MSSP add-ons
- Configure end-customer tenant add-ons as needed
- All calculations update in real-time

### Step 4: Set Pricing Controls
- Adjust markup multiplier using the slider (1.5x to 5.0x)
- Toggle between Monthly and Annual pricing views

### Step 5: Review Results
The sidebar displays:
- Complete cost breakdown
- Your total costs
- Customer pricing (with markup applied)
- Profit calculations and margin percentage

## üéØ Business Use Cases

- **Sales Presentations**: Professional tool for demonstrating value to prospects
- **Internal Planning**: Calculate costs for different customer scenarios
- **Pricing Strategy**: Test different markup multipliers and configurations
- **Proposal Generation**: Quick cost calculations for RFPs and quotes

## üîß Customization

The application is built with modularity in mind. Key areas for customization:

- **Pricing Data**: Update constants in `App.tsx` for new pricing
- **Styling**: Modify `App.css` and Tailwind classes for branding
- **Features**: Add new tenant types or add-ons by extending the data structures
- **Calculations**: Customize the pricing logic in the `calculations` useMemo hook

## üìä Key Metrics Calculated

- **Total Cost**: Base license + tenants + add-ons
- **Customer Price**: Total cost √ó markup multiplier
- **Profit**: Customer price - total cost
- **Profit Margin**: (Profit √∑ customer price) √ó 100

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Styling not loading**: Ensure Tailwind CSS is properly configured
2. **Calculations incorrect**: Check that all numeric inputs are properly parsed
3. **Responsive issues**: Test on different screen sizes and adjust CSS media queries

### Development Issues

- Ensure Node.js version compatibility
- Clear npm cache if experiencing installation issues: `npm cache clean --force`
- Restart development server after making configuration changes
